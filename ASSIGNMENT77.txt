ANSWER1...The CSS Grid Layout (commonly referred to as "Grid") is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows web developers to create complex, responsive web layouts with ease. It uses a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, which means it can handle both rows and columns, unlike the one-dimensional Flexbox which handles either a row or a column at a time.

ANSWER2...
Flexbox and Grid are both CSS layout models, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases:

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):

One-dimensional: Flexbox is designed for laying out items in a single dimension (either a row or a column).
Primary Use: Best suited for distributing space and aligning items in a single direction.
Usage: Ideal for simpler layouts like navigation bars, alignments, and single row/column structures.

Grid (Grid Layout):

Two-dimensional: Grid handles both rows and columns, making it more suitable for complex layouts.
Primary Use: Best suited for creating entire web page layouts or large sections of a page.
Usage: Ideal for creating complex responsive layouts with both horizontal and vertical dimensions.

ANSWER3..
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 1fr; /* Defines three columns: fixed, fixed, and flexible */
    grid-template-rows: auto 50px 1fr; /* Defines three rows: auto height, fixed height, and flexible */
}
grid-template-columns: Specifies the width of each column.
grid-template-rows: Specifies the height of each row.

display: grid;: Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its content.
